This repository provides source code, network models, and datasets (~17GB) for the DeepFocus project from Facebook Reality Labs.

The source code and network models were implemented with TensorFlow with 32-bit precision.

If you use this code and/or dataset, please cite the publication: Lei Xiao, Anton Kaplanyan, Alexander Fix, Matt Chapman, Douglas Lanman, "DeepFocus: Learned Image Synthesis For Computational Displays", SIGGRAPH Asia 2018.
